# DriveWorks MVC

A car parts management system built with ASP.NET Core MVC. This is one of my first projects working with ASP.NET, developed to learn and practice web development using the MVC architectural pattern.

## Project Overview
DriveWorks is a web application that manages car parts inventory and relationships between car brands, models, and their corresponding parts. The system features:

- User authentication and role-based authorization
- Car brands and models management
- Car parts inventory tracking
- Database seeding for initial data
- Entity Framework Core for data access
- Microsoft Identity for user management

## Technologies Used
- ASP.NET Core MVC
- Entity Framework Core
- Microsoft SQL Server
- Microsoft Identity
- Bootstrap (for styling)

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Update the connection string in `appsettings.json`
3. Run database migrations
4. Launch the application

This project serves as a learning experience for ASP.NET Core MVC development and demonstrates basic CRUD operations, authentication, and database management.
